# Question

`app.get(endpoint, controller)` takes in an `endpoint` as the first argument.

What is an endpoint in Express?

# Answer
An endpoint holds the destination/location of where the requests are sent to. Once the request is sent, clients can perform CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete respectively) on the data. This is where we can see `.get()` being used on the app.
