# Question

What is the job of a server application?

# Answer
The purpose of a server application is to listen for requests with `.get()` and send something back accordingly with `.send()`. To have access to these functions, we are using the `express` npm package. 

# Teacher Feedback

We are listening for requests however not all requests will be `.get()` requests.
