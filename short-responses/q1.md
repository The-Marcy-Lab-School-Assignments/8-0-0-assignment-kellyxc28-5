# Question

What is the job of a server application?

# Answer
The purpose of a server application is to listen for "CRUD requests" and send something back accordingly with `.send()`. The possible requests are:  `GET` (read), `POST` (create), `UPDATE` (update), `PATCH` (similar to update), and `DELETE` (delete). To have access to these functions, we are using the `express` npm package. 

# Teacher Feedback

We are listening for requests however not all requests will be `.get()` requests.
